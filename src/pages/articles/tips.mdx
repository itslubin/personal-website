ChatGPT has already invaded our lives, and with GPT-4 and its future updates on the horizon, the possibilities for enhanced interactions with AI are boundless. 
Today, I am going to show you some hacks to optimise your conversations with this fascinating AI. Let's get started!

## Tip 1: Structured Content Generation

If you need assistance with drafting content, provide ChatGPT with a clear outline or structure. For instance, if you're working on an essay, you can request a compelling introduction, key points for each paragraph, and a conclusion. By breaking down your requirements, you can guide ChatGPT to generate content that aligns with your needs.

For instance, you can use the next formula when it comes to writing some formal text to somebody.

> write a [length] [writing results] on [topic] in the style of [style]

Bonus tip: in the style section you can also provide authors or famous writers to be more specific.

## Tip 2: Assign roles

Sometimes, you may be in need of a grammar corrector, a history teacher, a code revisor or just a simply a colleague in your field to verify the accuracy of your writing. ChatGPT can do it for you.

Before prompting you request, you can add the following line:

> Act as [profession] and [action]

You can tell ChatGPT to write a new text, give you choice recommendations or explain to you complex concepts of that field. Giving ChatGPT a specific role will make its answers more concrete and accurate.

Bonus tip: you can also add the line &apos;explain to a child&apos; for simpler explanation.

## Tip 3: Format your outputs

Are you tired of the same format answers? You can prompt the type of output you want either to-do lists, a table, an outline or just a brief summary.

Currently, I am using the format of tables for different tasks like purchasing online or just doing the groceries. For instance, this prompt:

> Create a table of the different type of fruits for this season sorted by price, and a column for vitamins and nutrients, price and flavour

Note that ChatGPT is not the best data base, so you won&apos;t be able to see concrete prices or numbers as its data training only includes data up until September 2021.

## Tip 4: Upgrade your language

ChatGPT is a polyglot and knows any language available in the world. Not only that, but also it is proficient in all of them. So, imagine English is not you mother tongue and you have written an email to your boss, but you don&apos;t like the way you have written it. 

No problem, you can ask ChatGPT to upgrade your email. Here is how you can do it:

> Replace my simple vocabulary with advanced English &quot;I finished the report you told me to write yesterday. You can have a look at it&quot;

> &quot;I have completed the report as per your previous request, and it is now available for your perusal.&quot;

In fact, this can be also really useful for somebody who is preparing for an official language exam in the writing part ðŸ˜‚

## Tip 5: Rephrase

This tip can be quite obvious, but it is really powerful if you are gathering information for an essay or some kind of formal report. You can use this tool within ChatGPT or copy text from other sources.

> Rephrase this text: &quot;...&quot;

Note that ChatGPT can have biases and can be susceptible to plagiarism, so always be aware of that.

I hope these tips help!
